        <h2>About Indexer Control</h2>
        <p>
            The Control Window is located in the lower right of the display area and is 
            the main means of controlling the stepper motor. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The "Engage" button turns on the power to the stepper motor. 
        	Whenever power is applied to the stepper, that position becomes the new zero reference point. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The "GoToZero" button will always return the spindle back to the "zero" reference position.
        	Note that the spindle wraps around from 360 degrees back to 0 degrees. 
        	So if, for example, the rotation has gone to a total rotation of 370 degrees, then 
        	pressing the "GoToZero" button will cause the spindle to go back only 10 degrees 
        	(which is the same as zero). 
        </p>
        <p>
        	The "GoToNext" button causes the stepper motor to rotate to the next "filled" hole 
        	on the most recently selected IndexWheel.  
        </p>
        <p>
        	The speed of the spindle rotation is controlled by the slider with the "Slow" and "Fast" label.
        	When the slider is all the way to the right, the spindle rotates at 10rpm unless limited to a 
        	smaller value by the stepper driver). 
        	You can set the speed slower so that you can make cuts while rotating from one index point
        	to the next.
        </p>
        <p>
        	As a reminder, the most recently selected IndexWheel's name is displayed in the 
        	Control Window. Also, the current position of the spindle (in degrees) is shown.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The user can manually rotate the spindle by setting the speed slider as desired 
        	and pressing the "CCW" or "CW" button. 
        	This is useful in the event that the user needs to align to a certain position prior 
        	to resetting the zero reference. 
        	(Alternately, the user may turn off power to the stepper motor with the "Engage" 
        	button, manually rotate the spindle, and then "Engage" the stepper again).
        </p>
        <h2>Indexer Preferences -- Hardware</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to a variety of common preference settings, the "Hardware" tab must be 
            set by the user to indicate certain unique values for the particular hardware being used.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Stepper motors are usually in 1.8 degree steps (200 steps per rotation) or 
        	0.9 degrees per step (400 steps per rotation). 
        	This value must be set to be consistent with the stepper motor you are using. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Micro-stepping is a function of the driver board you are using. 
        	The Phidgets 1062 board uses 1/2 step micro-stepping, 
        	and the 1063 board uses 1/16 step micro-stepping.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The number of teeth on the small pulley/gear (i.e. the one on the motor) and the
        	number of teeth on the large pulley/gear (i.e. on the spindle) must be specified.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The Phidgets 1062 board can drive up to 4 stepper motors. 
        	You need to indicate which one of the 4 positions connects to the spindle stepper motor.
        	The Phidgets 1063 board only drives a single motor, so this cannot be changed if you have
        	a 1063 board connected.
        </p>
        <p>
        	When using a 1063 board, you can set the motor's current limit with software. 
        	See the 1063 manual for details on setting the current limit. 
        	Do not set this to a value greater than the maximum current for your stepper motor 
        	or more than your power supply can provide.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The acceleration determines how fast the stepper motor comes up to speed (and slows down). 
        	If this is set to too high a number, your stepper motor may lose counts if it 
        	doesn't have sufficient torque to accelerate the spindle. 
        	This might be the case if you have a very heavy chuck mounted on the spindle.
        	The default value is set to a very safe value for a typical JET mini-lathe with a 
        	VicMarc V-100 chuck (which weighs 3.6 pounds). 
        </p>
        <h2>Menu Actions</h2>
        <h3>Control</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Go To Zero</b> -- Return the spindle to the zero reference position as outlined above.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Go To Next</b> -- Rotate the spindle to the next filled hole as outlined above.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Set Zero</b> -- Set the current position of the spindle to become the new zero reference point.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Set Position to...</b> -- Enter a spindle rotation (in degrees). 
				This is a convenient means to set the current position of the spindle to a specific value. 
			</li>
