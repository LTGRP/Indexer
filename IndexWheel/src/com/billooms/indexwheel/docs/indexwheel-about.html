        <h2>About IndexWheels</h2>
        <p>
            A software-based IndexWheel is essentially the same as a regular lathe index wheel 
            which has been made out of metal with holes in it. 
            It is defined by the number of holes (which the user can specify) 
            which are equally spaced around the wheel. 
            Some of the holes can be "filled" which means that the IndexWheel will stop there 
            during rotation. 
            Other holes can be left "un-filled" which means that the IndexWheel will not stop 
            there during rotation.
        </p>
        <p>
        	In addition to having some number of holes, the IndexWheel can be phase-shifted or 
        	offset by some amount. 
        	The amount is specified as being anywhere within the range of one hole spacing by setting 
        	a phase shift number in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Any number of IndexWheels can be described. 
        	The user can specify a unique name for each wheel for convenience. 
        	All IndexWheels are rotated together as if one had multiple metal plates on the
        	spindle of a lathe that rotated together.

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)
