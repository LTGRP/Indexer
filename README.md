# Indexer
This software drives a stepper motor connected to the spindle of any lathe to be 
used in place of a traditional index wheel. 
The software can handle multiple index wheels and each can have any number of holes. 
The software allows for phase differences between the various wheels. 
Patterns can be programmed so that some holes of the wheel are used and other holes are skipped.
