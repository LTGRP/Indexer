        <h2>About IndexWheel Editor</h2>
        <p>
            The IndexWheel Editor Window is the main user interface for viewing/creating/changing IndexWheels.
            The top portion of the window shows a graphical representation of the most recently selected wheel.
        </p>
        <p>
        	To select a particular IndexWheel for viewing/editing, simply click on one of the 
        	IndexWheels in the lower left portion of the window. 
        	The number of IndexWheels in the current project can be increased or decreased as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
        	After a particular IndexWheel has been selected, it's basic properties can be edited in several ways:
        </p>
        <p>
        	First, one can right-click on the selected IndexWheel and choose "Properties". 
        	A new window will pop up to allow editing of the number of holes, the display name, 
        	and the phase. 
        	Note that the rotation cannot be directly edited, as it is changed to be in sync 
        	with the stepper motor driving the spindle by the Control Window.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Second, one can go to the main menu and select "Window" -> "Properties" which will 
        	bring up a window on the right edge of the display area. 
        	This window will remain open until explicitly closed by the user. 
        	Selecting a different IndexWheel will display the new data in the Properties WIndow.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Third, there are controls in the bottom of the IndexWheel Editor Window for changing 
        	the properties. 
        	One can change the number of holes or change the name. 
        	To change the phase, one can type in a number directly (in the range 0.0 to 1.0), or 
        	one can move the slider. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	Holes can be filled or un-filled by simply doing a single click on any hole 
        	shown in the display area of the window. 
        	Each click will toggle the state of the hole. 
        	One can also fill in some number of holes with the controls in the "Fill Holes" 
        	panel near the lower right of the IndexWheel Editor Window. 
        	Simply specify the first hole to be filled (note that the holes start with zero), 
        	indicate the spacing of the filled holes, and select the "Fill" button. 
        	This can be done multiple times with various values. 
        	The fills are accumulated from each press of the "Fill" button. 
        	All holes can be filled with the "Fill All" button. 
        	All holes can be returned to their un-filled position with the "Clear All" button.
        </p>
		<p>
			A selected IndexWheel can be deleted from the list by right-clicking on an IndexWheel
			in the list and selecting "Delete". 
			Note that you won't be able to delete the last one -- there must always be at 
			least one IndexWheel in the list.
